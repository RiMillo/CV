# CV
Repository for my `LaTeX` CV. They were originally, and still are, on [OvearLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project). Three versions:
 * English
 * Italian
 * French

They are based on a template by [Jan Küster](www.jankuester.com) which I found on OverLeaf. I did not keep the original files, but there is a [Git repository](https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv). Some adaptations have been made and new environments defined. Let's keep the orginal photos if you ever want to recompile the original or test a new version with the images (one never knows).
